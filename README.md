## The End of Ino

Arturo was originally a fork from [ino/master](https://github.com/amperka/ino/commit/f23ee5cb14edc30ec087d3eab7b301736da42362).
The original ino contributors did a fantastic job but they decided they no longer
had time to maintain this tool. I asked them if they wanted me to take over ino
but they preferred that I fork it. And so Arturo was born.

I spent some time working on a v2 that was a complete re-write. I had lofty goals
but not a lot of time and not much interest from collaborators.

![Platformio Logo](docs/platformio-logo.png)

As I was working on this problem so was [Platformio](http://platformio.org/). Once I became aware of this project and started using it I realized there was no need for Arturo. As such I'm archiving the entire project and am no longer accepting merge requests or providing support. I encourage you to use platformio if you want an excellent command-line utility for building Arduino projects.
